				<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
				<p class="center">Effective July 20, 2025</p>
				<p>Memokoi is a browser extension/add-on designed to help users save and manage websites they visit by allowing them to organize URLs, descriptions, and personal tags. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that any data stored through this extension remains under your control.</p>
				<p>We do <b>not</b> collect, transmit, or store personal data on any external server. All information remains within your browser's own storage environment and is managed solely by the browser APIs (e.g., Chrome Storage Sync, Firefox Storage).</p>
				<p>We value your privacy and believe in transparency. We ensure that you understand how your personal information is handled. This policy outlines how we handle any data that may be collected during your interaction with our website and applications.</p>
				<hr />
				<h3>Information We Collect</h3>
				<p>We collect and store the following information locally in your browser:</p>
				<ul class="l l1">
					<li><b>Saved site information:</b> This includes the name/title of a website, its URL, a user-provided description, and associated tags.</li>
					<li><b>Tab count metadata:</b> The extension may keep track of how many tabs are currently open for a saved URL to display dynamic counts.</li>
					<li><b>User preferences:</b> Theme, color, or UI-related settings to customize the extension’s appearance.</li>
					<li><b>User-created tags:</b> Tags added to saved websites for organizational purposes.</li>
				</ul>
				<blockquote>We do <b>not</b> collect personal identifying information such as email addresses, passwords, or browsing history beyond what you explicitly save.</blockquote>
				<hr />
				<h3>How We Use Information</h3>
				<p>Your data is used only for the core functionality of the extension:</p>
				<ul class="l l1">
					<li>To display your list of saved sites, tags, and tab counts</li>
					<li>To personalize your user interface preferences (theme, color, etc.)</li>
					<li>To help populate forms using basic metadata (e.g., page title and description)</li>
					<li>To provide import/export functionality for portability</li>
				</ul>
				<p>This data is <b>never</b> transmitted to our servers (we don’t have any), nor used for advertising, analytics, or profiling.</p>
				<blockquote>If you contact us, we will use your information to respond to and resolve your queries and complaints. When doing so, we perform our contractual obligation towards you.</blockquote>
				<hr />
				<h3>How We Share Information</h3>
				<ul class="l l1">
					<li>We do not sell, rent, or share your information to any third parties.</li>
					<li>All data is stored using your browser’s built-in storage.</li>
				</ul>
				<blockquote>You are in <b>full</b> control of your data, and it <b>never</b> leaves your browser without your explicit action (e.g., using export).</blockquote>
				<hr />
				<h3>How Long We Keep Your Information</h3>
				<p>All data remains stored in your browser until:</p>
				<ul class="l l1">
					<li>You uninstall the extension</li>
					<li>You manually delete the data using the extension UI or developer tools</li>
					<li>You clear your browser’s extension storage</li>
				</ul>
				<p>We do <b>not</b> retain any data on our side and have <b>no</b> access to your stored data.</p>
				<hr />
				<h3>User Rights</h3>
				<p>Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding your data.</p>
