				<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>

						<code>localStorage</code> until you uninstall the extension or manually clear the data.
					</li>
					<li>If your <code>storage.sync</code> data (<code>userId</code>) is deleted, your Supabase data tied to the
						previous <code>userId</code> will be inactive. However, reopening the extension will generate another
						<code>userId</code> if none exists.
