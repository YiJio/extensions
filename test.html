					<h2>🎉 Memokoi was updated to 2.0.0!</h2>
					<p>Thanks for continuing to use <strong>Memokoi</strong>.</p>
					<p><b>Important changes</b></p>
					<ul class="l l1">
						<li>🧠 Now built using React + TypeScript</li>
						<li>📂 Storage now saved to local instead of sync due to limits</li>
						<ul class="l l2">
							<li>This means sites only get saved to current device and will not sync across different devices for same browser profile.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>🏷️ Better tag creation via multiselect</li>
						<li>📥 JSON import/export with overwrite rules</li>
					</ul>
					<hr />
					<p><b>What this means for existing users (you)</b></p>
					<ul class="l l1">
						<li>Unfortunately, how data is stored originally (sync storage) will not be used in the new update.</li>
						<li>Sites will have to be added in once again.</li>
						<ul class="l l2">
							<li>Yes, this problem was exactly what Memokoi was designed to solve and yet the update has failed to accomplish that 😔.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>However, your originally saved sites in sync storage is still ——hopefully, if you didn't manually delete them—— accessible by you and only you.</li>
						<ul class="l l2">
							<li>You can retrieve it by right-clicking the extension and clicking on "Inspect > Application > Extension storage > Sync" under "sites" key.</li>
						</ul>
